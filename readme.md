## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first project using tailwind css, and also the most toughest project I have ever made. I try my best to replicate the design but it is not easy.I get to know about many properties of tailwind and how to use it to create mobile first websites. The best part of this project is creating the design of the mobile, it is trickiest part of this tricky project.

### Continued development

There are stills some bugs in the project, like I didn't able to design my radio inputs in the mobile design and it also overflow at some places when used in small screens but I will solve this issues in the future.
